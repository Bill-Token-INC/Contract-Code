# Contract-Code
Here is our contract code for the ETH version of BILL, the BSC version is managed by a third party platform called AnySwap.


ABOUT $BILL:

BILL is a token built on the Ethereum Blockchain and is used to gain access to NoRug.com.

 NoRug is an exclusive launchpad that gives BILL holders access to safe and unruggable meme coins.

The only way to access the NoRug Platform is to hold BILL in your wallet.

 The more BILL you hold in your wallet, the more access you will have based on a Tiered System which is still in development.
